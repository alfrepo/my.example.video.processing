# Java Video Stream Processing PoC

This project demonstrates a basic Proof of Concept (PoC) for working with video streams in Java. It utilizes the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library (specifically, the Java bindings) to capture video from a source (e.g., webcam, video file) and perform simple processing.  This example focuses on reading and displaying the video frames.  Further processing can be easily added.

## Features

* **Video Capture:** Reads video frames from a specified source (webcam or file).
* **Frame Display:** Displays the captured frames in a window.
* **Basic Processing (Optional):**  The structure is set up to easily add basic processing like grayscale conversion or edge detection.  This example does not include processing by default to keep it simple.
* **Cross-Platform:** OpenCV is cross-platform, making this project potentially portable.

## Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):**  Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed (e.g., Java 8 or later).
* **OpenCV Library:** You'll need to download and install the OpenCV library with Java bindings.  Refer to the official OpenCV documentation for instructions specific to your operating system.  It usually involves downloading the library, setting environment variables, and adding the OpenCV JAR file to your project's classpath.  A common approach is using Maven or Gradle.
* **IDE (Recommended):** An Integrated Development Environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse is recommended for development.

## Build and Run

### Using Maven (Recommended)

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
